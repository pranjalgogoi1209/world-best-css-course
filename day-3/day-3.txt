    * Tint : A pure color with just white added.
    * Shade : A pure color with just black added.
    * Tone : A pure color with just gray aded.


# CSS COLOR FACT => 

    * When you see six-digit hexadecimal codes in the format #RRGGBB, where each pair represents the intensity of the red (RR), green (GG), and blue (BB) components, and the digits are the same (e.g., #333 OR #CCC), it creates shades of gray.
